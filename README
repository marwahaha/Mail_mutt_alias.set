This script permit to insert an alias from the mutt aliases file while editing an
e-mail within vim.

Since the version 2.0, we can hit <tab> (in INSERT-mode) within an address 
field (To:, Cc:, Bcc:, Reply-To) to expand an alias. 
If several contacts match the to-be-expanded pattern, a menu is proposed in a 
splitted window in order to choose the addresses. 

Dependencies :
v2.x+ : a.vim                http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=31
          Actually, you should download an old version of a.vim that still exports its functions

v2.2+ : words_tools.vim http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=143


N.B.: The command (:Ca) and the macro (,Ca) have been abandoned since version 2.3.
